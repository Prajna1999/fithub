For some, it means running a \\nmarathon or having a buff, muscular bodybuilder's physique to show off at the beach. For others, it's just the ability to carry a baby or a bag of groceries up a flight of stairs without panting. For the purposes of this book, fitness means having a healthy, \\nfunctiona l body-one that enables you to lead a comfortably active life. The book also \\nwill touch on activities such as Tae Bo, tai chi, yoga, and advanced training tips that might not interest you now, but they might gain new appeal as you get into shape. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Fitness is not only an end unto itself. It also is a major component of wellness, which \\nincludes physical and mental health and emotional well-being. A physically active child can be on the right road to a lifetime of fitness. A fit teenager will have a wholesome body image, an ability to compete in sports, and enhanced self-esteem. An adult with a workout program can better combat work-related stress, and fit women usually have more comfortable pregnancies, easier childbirth, and quicker recovery than out-of-shape women. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Fit people are more likely to stay well, active, and productive through their middle \\nyears when heart disease, cancer, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues begin to crop up. People who retain, or even build, their fitness late in life can remain active and vital for many years. As we age as a population, such quality-of-life issues are not trivial; they are becoming more important to us as individuals and as a nation and society that is living longer and becoming more conscious of quality of life. Fitness should not be a fling but a lifetime commitment. When you get into a regular program, exercise can become addictive, and it's the best addiction you can have. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Inactivity—a National Crisis\\n  \\n \\n  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='98e7c0ba-2ec2-4707-8479-c5bbc695c779', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '52', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='79ebbfbbeda659a3d11908dcd6e216a72a725e58d6a072a2de80a74060476e3b', text=\" So much has been written about exercise and diet that millions of Americans are quite \\nknowledgeable about these subjects and how they relate to healthy living. But how many people really act on this knowledge? Far too few. Americans are fat and frustrated. According to recent statistics, some 34 percent of the adults in this country are overweight and close to 20 percent are dangerously obese. At the same time, about half of them are trying to reduce. They'd better. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n In 1996, the U.S. Surgeon General issued a massive report that concluded, among other \\nthings, that inactivity kills about a quarter of a million Americans every year-far more than automobile accidents, shootings, and AIDS combined. The results of inactivity and obesity creep into many corners of our collective life. Ferry boats across Washington State's Puget Sound used to carry 250 passengers; these days, only 230 commuters can scrunch their posteriors onto each boat. Airlines are required to carry seat-belt extenders on every plane, and many are raising the tray tables to fit over passengers' tubby tummies. Even toilet seats are getting bigger-by customer demand! \\n  The national standard for public seating space used to be 18 inches. Now, some sports \\nstadiums and theaters are installing 24-inch seats. Isn't it pathetic that the stands are full of overweight people who fuel up on fatty foods and beers as they watch millionaire sports stars play games? People also sit in movie theaters and ingest buttered popcorn, humongous sodas, and brick-size boxes of candy as svelte, overpaid movie stars cavort onscreen. What is wrong with this picture? Everything. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n We are not the only fat-afflicted society in the industrial world. According to Marks \\nand Spencer, Britain's biggest clothing retailer, the average Englishwoman is now a size 16 as compared to the average size of 12 in the 1950s. Women have steadily added inches to their waistlines and hips. The culprits? A more sedentary lifestyle and fast food—the same as in America. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Many studies have shown that exercise, in combination with a wholesome diet, is the \\nonly effective, permanent way to get weight under control—and to enjoy good health and a life of activity and fun. As the baby boom generation continues to bulge, so do the cases of high blood pressure, heart disease,  and some kinds of cancer that have been \\nstatistically linked to obesity. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='4cd7cc9e-7dac-4a35-abbe-b3ae8efa6b67', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '53', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='583452da633e0fa199c11b5cb4932482c9aa7971136041bc4ea9baebbdc7cd72', text=' Boomer women also are coping with issues ranging from late-life pregnancy and \\nmenopause to the specter of osteoporosis.

As life expectancy increases, the quality of life ought to keep up. Who wants to live a long but inactive and perhaps painful life full of restrictions and problems?

Others don\\'t work out because they don\\'t believe they can do it; being afraid of failure, they don\\'t start at all. But everyone can get stronger and healthier. This book will compare and contrast what\\'s out there in terms of both targeted workout programs and participant sports. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Diet books and, worse, potentially harmful weight-loss formulas sell like proverbial hot \\ncakes (hold the butter and use low-sugar syrup, of course), but many studies have shown that exercise, in combination with a healthful diet, is the only effective, permanent way to lose weight and keep it off—and also to enjoy good health.

Not a month goes by without some major women's magazine or general-interest publication doing a cover story on shaping up. Television infomercials promise a sure route to leanness.

It outlines a vast array of classes and tools to help you slim down, tone up, increase your strength and endurance, become healthier, and remain happier.

As \\npreviously noted, excess weight and a sedentary lifestyle are linked with heart disease, stroke, and diabetes in both genders. Women who do not exercise are vulnerable to a host of other chronic problems. From the age of 40 on, most women lose one half to one third of a pound each of muscle and bone every year and often gain body fat in its place. In perimenopause, which precedes menopause, these changes accelerate. More than one third of American women aged 30 to 49 are already overweight, and by age 50, that figure jumps to more than 50 percent. That's half the female American population inviting osteoporosis, broken bones,  fatigue, frailty, depression, and more \\nfrom lack of exercise. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Not only can exercise alleviate many current health problems and ward off future ones, \\nit also can reveal various disorders.

You don't have to get dressed to go out, you don't have to figure into your workout schedule the time it takes to drive to and from the gym, and your shower is right there. You can slip a video into your VCR and make it your main exercise routine, or you can use it to supplement walking, running, classes, or a gym membership. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Select your videos as you would classes at  a gym. Ask yourself some basic questions. \\nYour answers can help steer you to the appropriate videos. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ What are your goals?  There are videos for general conditioning, aerobic videos for \\nfat-burning, strength-training videos, yoga videos that enhance flexibility and \\nrelaxation, tai-chi videos that are ideal for older exercisers, and more. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Do you like simplicity or glamour?  Videos using simple studio sets and a trainer \\nwho is not a star might appeal to some people, while others might prefer to work out \\nwith a big-name trainer whose program is captured in a glamorous location. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Are you a beginner or do you have some experience?  Videos aim at all exercise \\nlevels. If you are just starting an aerobics or step program, for instance, you'll want a \\nsimple program that you can do easily. If you are intrigued by kickboxing, be sure to start with a basic program to get the moves right and prevent injury. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='0dde2bad-c06c-4138-9d9a-b66805f56933', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '120', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='f2fe957e8840ed0f8be7de23b1036142f58641875cc75817ceae662db87302a6', text=\" ♦ What are your musical tastes?

It comes on at the same time every day, so you get the same built-in scheduling that a fitness class offers but with the convenience of scheduling it at home. If you like a particular instructor, you can make your own tape and play it whenever you like. A number of half-hour shows can fit on one tape, and you can even pause during the taping to delete commercials. As with other videos, you then can play it at your convenience. If one segment deals with a problem area you particularly want to tone, such as abdominals or glutes, you can work \\nwith that show more often than the others. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n These television programs are like half-hour, on-air exercise classes. Most programs \\nthat focus on aerobics or weight training be gin with warm-ups and end with cooldowns, \\njust as a good instructor does in a live class. The shows never repeat the same exercises \\nor sequences two days in a row, so your interest will stay high. Each program tends to remain at the same level, however, and often is geared toward novice exercisers. Some shows include demonstrations at various levels of challenge, but others don't increase the difficulty level. This can stall you as your own level of fitness improves, and you might not continue to challenge yourself if you do nothing but work out with the same TV show. Still, exercise shows are convenient and can be really good for maintaining a fitness routine when you just can't get out to a gym. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n In addition to aerobics, weight training, a nd toning shows, you might find alternatives \\nsuch as yoga and tai chi on one of your offered channels. Fitness programs are concentrated on weekday mornings, especially on ESPN2 and stations affiliated with the Public Broadcasting System (PBS). You can find a current list of shows on www.thriveonline.com\\n. Some cable and satellite systems also receive a channel that \\nprovides nothing but workouts and fitness information. Remember, however, that infomercials for fitness products are not the same thing as instructional shows. Their purpose is not to help people get fit but to sell products. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  Teaming Up with a Workout Buddy\\n  \\n \\n  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='973bcabd-ca3a-452c-b19e-00cae72cd90f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '123', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='6827d635398c9bc40617393e4f9545a62d3c744129fd924eac34af5acda64007', text=\" \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n If you have trouble getting to the gym or going out for that walk or run, make a \\nstanding date with a friend.

If you like, you can begin to divvy them into aerobic and strength-training days. Not only does this add variety to your workout week, it also gives your muscles time to recover. Some people like a two-day cycle; others prefer a three-day cycle. Workout veterans tend to do these categories on alternate days. Some people like to do a full weight workout one day and an intense aerobics workout the next; others prefer one day of lower-body strength training, one  day of upper-body strength training, and \\none day of cardiovascular work. \\n  \\nWarm Up, Cool Down   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The warm-up at the beginning of a workout and the cool-down afterward have a couple \\nof things in common. Both involve relatively gentle movements and some stretching. The purpose of both the warm-up and the cool-down is to enhance flexibility, minimize discomfort, and even prevent injury. The warm-up specifically prepares the muscular system for the harder work to come. It helps you loosen up before your aerobic workout to get the blood flowing and to loosen your muscles for the upcoming exercises. The cool-down allows your body to relax, to discard some of the waste products and lactic acid you might have accumulated, and to return to a resting state after you are finished. Begin your workout with a couple of deep breaths, inhaling \\nthrough the nose and exhaling through the mouth. If you are planning to walk or run, do a few hundred yards at a slower walk or a gentle jog. Start an aerobics routine with a \\nfew minutes of light, dance-like motions to bring your heart-rate up slowly and gradually. This warm-up period is vital in increasing the blood flow to your muscles, which in turn makes muscles and connective tissue more elastic. Before you rev into your routine, do a few gentle calf, hamstring, and hip flexor stretches to limber up. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n The cool-down routine is similar, but in reverse—slowing the pace from your aerobic \\nwalk, run, or choreographed routine—to enable your heart rate to return to fewer than 100 beats per minute. Soon, your breathing and heart rates will return to normal. Your post-aerobic stretches can be stronger, because  muscles are more elastic after a workout \\nthan before. Done over time, these stretches help lengthen the muscles and make you more flexible. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  The Flexibility Factor   \\n  \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e9aac9d2-95ea-4e2f-b42f-3ad33be8cb0a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '142', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='8191a4eb3580286c247a7c2accf54b938ca4d92429a78addb8165142a6ae0db7', text=\" \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Stretching is the unappreciated stepchild of the fitness family, but it can make or break \\nthe rest of your fitness program.

However, stretching requires caution to prevent injury. Somehow, it seems easier to get into the habit of stretching some muscle groups than others. Stretching the long leg muscles after a walk or a run comes naturally and feels good, but people tend to neglect other parts of the body such as the knees. In any case, do not stretch to the point of pain. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n There are two basic types of stretches: the ballistic (or active) stretch and the static \\nstretch. The ballistic stretch uses momentum and motion to lengthen the muscle. Examples include a leg swing or an arm swing. Light ballistic stretches are an integral part of the warm-up before your workout. With the static (or passive) stretch, the muscle is lengthened as far as it comfortably will go and is held in that position. You can do a light static stretch during your warm-up and then stretch more aggressively after your cool-down while your muscles are still warm. To increase your flexibility, hold each stretch for 15 to 20 seconds or longer, release, and then repeat. You also can breathe deeply, intensifying the stretch as you exhale. There is a very good physiological reason only to stretch lightly during the warm-up and not to overdo your cool-down stretches. When you begin to stretch a muscle, especially a cold one, the muscle automatically reacts in the opposite way, contracting to resist the stretch. This is \\ncalled the stretch reflex.  To overcome it, it is important to stretch slowly and smoothly \\nwithout bouncing or jerking.

After a weight  workout, whether with free weights or \\nmachines, be sure to stretch all the muscle groups you worked—legs, arms, shoulders, and back. You can boost a static stretch with external pressure in various ways. Sometimes your trainer will apply pressure to a particular muscle to lengthen it. In some stretches, you can turn your own body against the stretch to provide pressure. You also can quickly contract the muscle to be stretched by pressing it against your trainer, your workout partner, or even the wall. When you release that contraction, you will be able to stretch farther than before. \\n  \\nWhen stretching, it is just as important not to put the joints or the spine at risk for injury \\nas it is to lengthen your muscles. Several common moves could cause problems. The hurdler's stretch (a favorite among track coaches, a seated stretch with one leg extended straight out and one leg bent and tucked next to the body) and the kneeling quadricep stretch (also called the knee-sit) both could injure the knee joint.

Men who work out more readily build round, beefy muscles—big shoulders, sculpted pectorals, bulging biceps, and the like. If you want to look as strong \\nas you are, it will only happen if you are not overweight. When a man starts weight-training, some muscles—back, pectorals, biceps, quadriceps—get stronger and firmer faster than others. Because men have the potential to build big muscles, their weight training shows results quickly. Still, fat on top of muscles hides the sculpted muscles that strength training builds. When it comes to muscular strength, size matters. In general, the bigger the muscle, the stronger it is. Men are genetically preconditioned to \\nbuild big muscles, so they are, in general, stronger than women. \\n  \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a0857f06-509d-47e0-bc35-ae9e1938356e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '167', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='dc876c3614b133867084d8a993dc95a37d244dea55224bde0d29bd095596d4b1', text=\" \\n \\n \\n  Women Need Weight Work, Too\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Women, who are significantly more likely to suffer bone loss, weakness, and fractures \\nlater in life, need weight training even more than men.

Some brands are labeled with clearly illustrated instructions for setting up each machine. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Typically, such weight-stack cable machines have several stations that enable you to \\nexercise various muscles. You will find specific stations for all major muscle groups: shoulders, back, chest, biceps, triceps, outer and inner thighs, hamstrings, and quadriceps. Some exercises require you to stand up, some to sit down, and some to lie down. \\n  Before you begin each exercise, adjust the seat for your height (if there is an adjustment) \\nand the weight stack for your program. Then begin lifting, pulling, or pressing, \\ndepending on the exercise. Try to stay in control throughout the exercise, lifting and releasing evenly and smoothly. \\n \\n \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a2f61361-44b9-4ef5-bdae-7877539cc70d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '184', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='05b6442fc6684075204867e833ad0482a7934277f95a0cb711f9bcf559db37f2', text=' \\n \\n The following chart outlines 10 terrific exercises for weight machines.

The exercises often are similar to weight-stack machines, but the mechanics are different. Instead of cables and pulleys to lift and lower weights, some machines have hydraulic (fluid) or pneumatic (air) chambers or cylinders to provide resistance. Proponents of these machines like the even resistance throughout each exercise with this type of equipment. Nautilus equipment was based on a somewhat different principle. The system's spiral pulleys mimic nature's nautilus seashell to provide smooth, full-range-of-motion resistance training. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  Working with Free Weights   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n As you progress and become stronger, you might wa nt to use barbells, but at least at the \\nbeginning of your fitness quest, light dumbbe lls are the free weights for you.

Under this approach, after warming up for each exercise with light weights, you increase the weight for each new set until you have reached the heaviest comfortable weight. If you haven't completed your planned reps by the time your muscle fatigues and your form begins to go, some trainers recommend that you rest briefly and then switch to the next-lightest weight, or even no weight, for the remainder of the set. Other trainers like people to warm up, begin with the heaviest possible weight, and then move to lighter weights to complete the set. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Early in your exercise career, when you are using very light weights with small-\\ndiameter handles, you can crisscross, say, a three-pounder and a one-pounder, holding them both in the same hand to add just a little weight. This can get tricky, however, if you have very small hands or if the handle is large, because it is possible to drop one. Although dumbbells are used primarily for upper-body exercises, they can also be used to add challenge to such lower-body exercises such as lunges, step-ups, or squats. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n Scores of variations exist for dumbbell exercises.

Arm or biceps curl.  Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, your knees \\nslightly bent, and your arms straight and close to your body, bend your elbows up to \\nyour chest. Straighten your arms and lower the weights to the starting position. The term arm curl  or biceps curl  is used when you do this exercise with the palms facing \\nthe ceiling. When you rotate your forearms so that your thumbs are facing the ceiling, the variation is called a hammer curl;  when you do it with the palms facing the floor, it \\nis called a reverse curl.

Chest press.  Lie on your back on a bench or a mat with your elbows bent, your \\nhands at chest level, and your palms toward your feet. Press your hands upward and straighten your elbows without locking them. Bend them to return to the starting position. This exercise strengthens the shoulders, triceps, and pectorals. You also can do this exercise with a barbell. When you do it on a bench, which gives you a greater range of motion, it is called a bench press.  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 6. Fly.  Lie on your back on a bench with your elbows slightly bent and your hands \\nabove your chest. (If you are uncomfortable on a bench, you also can do this exercise lying on a mat, but you won't get as much range of motion.) Extend your arms out to the side. Alternately open them and bring them together above your chest. Lying on a bench gives you a greater range of motion. This exercise strengthens the chest. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Weight-training accessories for special situations are also available. If arthritis is a \\nproblem that makes gripping hand weight s uncomfortable, try heavy-duty plastic \\nextenders called EZGrip, which clip onto the weights and provide a larger, more comfortable surface to hold on to. Call 877-439-4747 for details. Body-builders, of course, use support belts to prevent abdominal injuries while lifting heavy weights. \\nSome people like to wear gloves while working with weights (especially if and when \\nthey start using heavy weights). If you wear gloves, you can avoid blisters by getting the right size. When your gloves begin to wear out or stretch, it's time for a new pair.

The most versatile designs feature lead bar weights that slip into pouches and therefore can be adjusted for weight as well as size. Others, such as Lei Weights, contain small, heavy pellets. They are soft and comfortable and can be draped over the leg or used in place of dumbbells in other free-weight exercises. To intensify inner-and outer-thigh toning, hold the last rep of the last set for eight to 16 counts before \\nreleasing. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n No matter what design you prefer, the following are the two most common lower-body \\nexercises that use leg weights: \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 1. Outer-thigh leg lift.  Lie on your left side with your hip bones stacked one above the \\nother, perpendicular to the floor, with your left knee slightly bent. You can lift the right leg up and down, you can lift it and alternately bend and extend the knee, or you can combine these movements so that, on each rep, you lift, extend, bend, and lower the leg. Work up to two or three sets of 15 repetitions of each component of these outer-thigh lifts. You can complete the exercise by elevating your right leg to hip level and pulsing it for one set. Don't lift the right leg any higher than the hip, because you don't \\nwant to roll back onto your buttock. The idea is to keep the hip bones stacked. Switch \\nto the other side. This exercise tones your outer thighs. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 2. Inner-thigh leg lift.  Lie on a mat or on the floor, as in the preceding exercise. Bend \\nyour top leg and place it on the floor in front of your body. Raise your bottom leg off the floor and lower it to the starting position. Again, be sure to lift your leg without rolling onto your buttock. Your goal should be the same number of reps and sets on each side as for the outer-thigh leg lift.

Remember that you will build up and tone your muscles by working against resistance. To strength-train, you need to work your muscles to fatigue.

Others are traditional calisthenics that you might have done in a long-ago gym class. They get the joints and muscles moving to provide general toning and mobility conditioning rather than specific strength or aerobic training. Several target the lower body, which many people say they most want to tone. For each of the exercises that follow, begin with a set of eight to 10 reps if you can, rest, and then do another set. When sets of eight or 10 become easy, increase the number of reps in increments of five and then up the number of sets to three or four. The key to success is slow, controlled movement through a full range of motion. Mega-reps are not necessary. Ultimately, you can notch yourself up to more advanced versions of these exercises. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Abdominal Crunches   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Crunches are the most basic abdominal exercises in fitness today. There are countless \\nvariations on the theme of crunches. In all of them, you begin by lying on your back with your lower back pressed against the mat or floor, your knees bent, and your feet flat on the floor. Begin by contracting the a bdominal muscles and then slowly lift and \\nlower your head, shoulders, and upper back. You can select your arm position. If you feel tension in your neck, place your hands behind your head with your fingers interlaced or touching. If your neck does not bother you, you can extend your arms straight in front of you or overhead, or you can place them on your thighs and slide them up as you lift your upper body, shoulders, and head. If you are comfortable doing so, you can cross your hands over your chest. Some trainers advise clients to tuck the chin in; others advise to keep the cervical area straight. Lightening  your feet off the \\nfloor, thus releasing weight from them, as you lift your upper body makes the crunch more challenging. You can feel this effect by alternately raising your right and left toes with each crunch. \\n  ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='448c91e3-c517-4e83-8c5a-b60e507f6c03', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '200', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='86b13f75dbcddbf7dc584eef7751c4f58189fd040c1813e6e05ade57ca1751ad', text=' \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n No matter what variation you select on the abdominal crunch theme, \\nkeep your lower back flat on the mat. \\n (Photo: Anne W.

Work through the entire exercise slowly and steadily, without heaving yourself up or flopping down. \\n  \\nModified Crunches   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Crunches work the entire rectus abdominus, but  several other exercises also concentrate \\non the lower section of the abdominal area. The easiest of these is a crunch with a modification. Lie on your back as you would to  start your crunches, but let your knees \\nfall outward, keeping your feet together. When you do your crunches from this butterfly position, you will feel your lower abs handling more of the load. To tone the \"love handle\" area on the sides of your torso, you need to work your obliques. The easiest version is to place your hands behind your head for support and begin alternating your left shoulder toward your right knee and then your right shoulder toward your left knee. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n You also can increase the intensity of your abdominal exercises by doing a pulse set \\nafter your regular crunches.

Other advanced abdominal exercises involve more challenging \\npositions. For example, you can lift your legs off the floor and cross your ankles when you do your crunches to really work your waist. Reverse curls are the power exercise for the lower abs. Lie on your back, lift your legs straight up (or raise them and cross them at your ankles), and place your hands under your pelvis to support your back. Contract your abdominals to raise your hips o ff the floor. Be sure to suck in your gut \\nwith each lift, or else your back and hip flexors will do most of the work.

Such devices have been around for years, but seductive television infomercials, often with celebrity endorse ments, imbue them with an in-your-face \\npresence that makes them hard to ignore. Many of the products hawked on television also are available at discount stores, sporting goods retailers, and perhaps even supermarkets. Some products are sturdy and decently built; others are flimsy and marginally effective at best. It's hard to tell on the TV screen, and most people just shove purchasing mistakes away rather than take advantage of the money-back guarantees that usually are part of the offers. If a product seduces you, try to take a good look at a real sample and evaluate its quality in relation to its price.

You just needed to lie on your back on the floor and alternately move the left leg/right arm and right leg/left arm. More recent abdominal exercisers have been tubular devices twisted into a cagelike form. You rest your head on a pad, and your hands grasp the side supports as you work your abdominals by doing caged crunches.

Sit squarely on the ball. Slowly walk your feet out and \\nsimultaneously roll down onto your spine until your torso is parallel to the floor. \\nSlowly roll back up, contracting your abdominal muscles to help regain the sitting position. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Back strengthener.

Slowly walk your hands forward so that \\nthe ball rolls down the length of your body past your hips. If you can, keep moving until your thighs are resting on the ball, maintaining a straight line from your head to your knees. Walk your hands back to return to the starting position.

This push-up is easiest when the ball is under your hips, it is harder when the ball is under your thighs, and it is more challenging still when the ball is under your lower leg. These push-ups tone the pectorals, deltoids, and triceps.

Some clubs offer yoga-derived classes directed toward enhancing a sport, such as weight-lifting, swimming, or cycling.

This system refers to the ancient body-mind discipline founded by the \\nsage Patanjali, and it includes classical asanas, pranayarsa  (breath practices), and \\nmeditation. A modern teacher named PataGhi Jo also refers to his style of teaching as Ashtanga yoga. This latter style is based on a series of challenging poses repeated over and over, with emphasis on a particular type of heating breath as the movement flows from one pose to another. It is easy to get comfortable with this style because you keep repeating and working to perfection the same poses. Once your poses are perfected, you can go on to a higher series. Each series takes about 90 minutes. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Bikram.  This is asana  in a furnace. The poses are similar, but the setting is different. \\nBikram practitioners do 26 specific yoga poses in a very hot room. This helps warm \\nand loosen your muscles, but some people find it uncomfortable. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Hatha.  This term usually is applied to classical body yoga. If it is meant to evoke \\nanything, the sense is of meditative and delib erate poses and counterposes that integrate \\nthe body, breath, and mind. It is designed to move subtle energies in specific patterns and to balance and harmonize endocrine functions. If you sign up for a nonspecific yoga class, this is probably what you'll get. It's a good introduction. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Integral.  This is fusion yoga. It incorporates elements from various yoga systems \\ninto a 90-minute class that follows a prescribed progression. It includes poses, \\nrelaxation, and meditation. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Iyengar.  A modern movement, this is the Pilates of yoga emphasizing body \\nalignment and precise movements and poses. In its purest form, this strenuous style \\nrequires practitioners to hold poses for up to two minutes, which can seem like an eternity. It is excellent for conditioning because of its challenge, but many beginning exercisers find it way too challenging. It also can employ blocks, belts, ropes, and other \\nprops to help less flexible or injured people reach the poses. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='2411ec98-fe3b-4910-b9e7-035fe1c018fd', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '229', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='d930df6f537b8829e6690edd37d9f60a1aaa775eceffe0dccd1c87ac786bed12', text=' ♦ Kripalu.  This three-part system begins with the understanding and practice of \\nvarious postures, breathing, and movement. At the second stage, postures are held \\nlonger, and class members are encouraged to understand their feelings about what they are doing with their bodies.  \\n \\n  \\n♦ Kundalini.  This refers to an ancient style of yoga in which the spiritual energy of the \\nbody is deliberately activated to attain higher consciousness. A modern teacher, Yogi \\nBhajan, also uses this term to refer to a style of asana  that uses a rapid-breathing \\ntechnique in each posture while that posture is being held. This is an excellent selection if you are stressed and want to harness Eastern philosophy to learn to relax, but like Iyengar, it requires you to hold each pose for a long time and is therefore very demanding. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Sivanda.  During 90-minute classes, students gently practice the postures in the Sun \\nSalutation (see the next section), meditation, and deep relaxation, all of which are \\ncombined with chanting. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Viniyoga.  Mantras, chanting, meditation, and twisting postures that work deep into \\nthe musculature, organs, and glands are combined in this branch of yoga. It can be \\nphysically gentle but is complex and layered. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n In basic classes, yoga often is presented as a one-style-fits-all discipline, but after you \\nget beyond the introduction, its complexities unfold. You might have to shop around a bit to find the type that suits you best. \"Picking the right style for each individual is crucial,\" says Dr. Sarasvati Buhrman of the Rocky Mountain Institute of Yoga and Aryuveda in Boulder, Colorado. \"From a classical perspective, different poses and different styles of yoga asana  affect basic dohsas  or bioenergies in different ways. \\nPeople differ from one another physically, physiologically, mentally, and emotionally, \\nso it is important to match the practice with the person.

Deep inhalation—filling the upper, middle, and bottom of the lungs—elevates the body's core temperature and helps make the muscles flexible. Interestingly, it also conditions your lungs just as exercise conditions the muscles. Yoga practitioners actually have increased lung volume, and their bodies have an enhanced ability to deliver oxygen to their muscles and organs. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Inversion Positions   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n Inverted yoga positions are those in which the head is lower than the torso.

The facial muscles get to relax, and wrinkles tend to get fluffed. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n ♦ Inversions improve health and vitality. They aid in digestion, which helps with \\nweight loss.

Like Pilates, Gyrotonics aims at \\nelongating, realigning, stretching, toning, and conditioning the body. It has two \\ncomponents: with apparatus and without apparatus. Gyrotonic Expansion System exercises are done on a mat, and Spinal Dynamics exercises are gentle, repetitive torso rotations that are done seated, standing, kneeling, and prone on a mat. The Gyrotonics \\napparatus resembles a bench with a towerlike structure at one end and with straps, \\nhandles, and pulleys plus weight plates for added resistance. Breathing plays an \\nimportant role in the program, as it does in Pilates and yoga. Pilates facilities have now grown to the hundreds, but Gyrotonics is still fairly exclusive. The apparatus is expensive, few trainers have been schooled in it, and it has not yet achieved popular status.

The Feldenkrais (pronounced FELL-den-krise)  Method and the Alexander Technique both aim to \\nrebalance and realign the body for pain management, flexibility, coordination, and conduct of everyday activities. Both systems, which are practiced one-on-one with trained teachers and practitioners, gained favor with musicians and others who have to do repetitive movements in unnatural body positions. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  Life in Balance   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='acc5756b-49de-49a9-9749-2aa2291e785c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '242', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='29dc1b0996706eacac4856022d48f5ef19f0d0cf05e3822d0b981c5e4d535773', text=' \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n The goals of both ancient mind-body regimes and newer philosophies with mind-body \\norientation aim at improving balance, alignment, and flexibility.

Just as Billy Blanks took traditional martial arts and combined them with modern elements to create Tae-Bo, which is discussed in Chapter 17, \"Fight Your Way to Fitness\" other innovators have taken their inspiration from various lands and times and have used that inspiration as a foundation for contemporary routines. Here are some examples: \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Power Moves.  This is a choreographed melange of movements derived from several \\nEastern traditions. The class warms up with tai chi to \"awaken the power.\" It proceeds \\nwith postures and movements from Ashanti yoga to \"concentrate the power.\" Next, elements of kickboxing \"release the power.\" Finally, the cool-down is inspired by Ch\\'i Kung, and it \"calms the power.\" The instructor should emphasize the mind-body connection and proper breathing. For information, call 1-800-509-3607 or 805-646-0108. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ JoSand.  A workout pioneer who goes by the name of Johnny G is credited with \\ninventing Spinning. More recently, he devel oped a balancing act that he calls JoSand. \\nThe workout centers around a six-foot wooden stick, known in Japan as a jo. With the \\nstick balanced on the fingers, participants do a series of moves, such as short runs, \\njumps, squats, and turns. Johnny G claims a connection between the participant and \\nnature. In southern California, where this workout was created, it\\'s done on wet beach sand at low tide. Stay tuned to see whether it will show up at your local health club. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Aqua Yoga.  Water or aqua aerobics and water or aqua jogging have been around for \\na while, but more recently, water or aqua yoga and water or aqua tai chi have appeared \\non the scene. The benefits of body buoyancy, the resistance of water, and the impact-free aquatic environment are added to ancient Eastern arts. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ YogaFit.  This fast-moving hybrid combines the energy of aerobics with the flow and \\nflexibility of yoga. Like aerobics programs, YogaFit is choreographed to music, but \\nthat choreography uses yoga movements and postures.

Raise your right arm behind you so that your upper arm is parallel to the floor. Now extend your forearm straight back and then return it to the starting position. Repeat 10 to 15 times, and then switch arms. A second triceps exercise is to stand up straight a nd hold one dumbbell, or two lighter ones, behind \\nyour head. Keeping your elbows as close to your head as possible, bend and extend your elbows. Alternately bend and straighten. Do three sets of 10. As a final variation, you \\ncan do this exercise on a mat or on the floor. Lie on your back, and hold the dumbbells in your hands above your head with your elbows bent. Straighten your arms to raise the weights toward the ceiling, and then bend them to return to the starting position.

Some of these cardio machines mimic some kind of natural or sports activity but in a climate-controlled environment. Stationary bikes, rowing machines, treadmills, and other apparatus allow \\nyou to use the same muscles as you would bicycling, rowing, running, or walking \\noutdoors. Most can be programmed for a specific degree of challenge or can be operated in manual mode. Therefore, when you climb aboard, you can select the speed and/or resistance of these machines when you start and can readjust if necessary while you are exercising. In addition, elaborate display consoles on health-club models and even some high-end home models will help you monitor your workout. Where necessary, as on a stationary bicycle, these machines can be adjusted for users of various heights. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n Typically, when you get on a cardio machine and begin walking, pedaling, or whatever \\nmovement the machine requires, the display prompts a series of questions. You answer by touching a keypad and pressing \"Enter\" after each response. Questions might include your weight, your age, the length of time you would like to work out, the degree of challenge on a scale of 1 to 10 (or 12 or 16), and the program you prefer. Most exercise bikes ask you to select the profile of the \"ride\" you are taking (random, interval, hills, and so on). A treadmill allows you to select the angle of the track from flat to a somewhat steep incline. When you\\'ve gone through the menu of questions, your exercise session automatically begins, and unless you chose \"manual\" mode, the apparatus determines your workout. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n The machine\\'s digital display tracks your progress throughout your workout and shows \\nnumbers such as elapsed time, distance, and estimated caloric burn. Some machines have handles with heart-rate monitors that you can grip to check whether you are in your target heart rate zone, as measured through your palms and fingers. Many experts are not impressed with the accuracy of this function (see Chapter 10, \"Trainers\\' Tips and Tricks\"). By contrast, time and distance readings are more reliable. Calories burned and heart rate are less-exact measures, but you can use them to monitor your progress—especially if you frequently use the same machine.

If it is going too fast, or if the incline is too steep, you have to slow the belt speed down or decrease the angle; otherwise, you will eventually be \\ncarried off the back end.

You also can shift your workouts on a treadmill, a stairstepper, or an elliptical trainer, but not on a studio bike, because your feet can slip off the pedals and cause an injury.

On some machines, pushing one plate down automatically raises the other. On other machines, the pedals operate independently of one another. The motion resembles climbing an endless flight of stairs to nowhere, and it results in an excellent lower-body workout. You can adjust the resistance, and you derive aerobic benefit from the level you select and the speed you use to push the pedals. Bigger steps work the butt muscles more; smaller steps work the legs and calves more. In addition to time and calories, the display usually will tell you the equivalent of how many flights and often how many vertical feet you have climbed.

The bike feat ures a fixed gear and a heavy flywheel, the \\nweight of which creates momentum that forces you to pedal continuously. Because resistance can be adjusted, however, each participant can custom-tailor the workout to his or her current fitness level—and in studio cycling, there are as many \"hims\" as \"hers.\" The typical studio bike also has a racing saddle, contoured handlebars, pedals \\nwith toe clips, a tension knob that acts like a gear shift, a hand brake so you can stop the apparatus in an emergency, and a water-bottle holder for the hydration you will quickly need.

If your heart and lungs are in good shape, you have a giant leg up on getting fit because your cardiorespiratory heart and lungs can handle a real workout. If you have been getting aerobic exercise and are fit, these organs are healthy. If you are sedentary, you have to work up to a hard workout. In other words, you have to build both strength and endurance. Building your heart\\'s efficiency in pumping blood and your lungs\\' capabilities through aerobic exercise is crucial to maintaining (or restoring) your heart\\'s health. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Experts differ in what they consider to be the bare minimum of aerobic exercise that is \\neffective.

Studies have shown that overweight individuals have triple the normal risk of these diseases. Exercise is the best way to lower the risks. Even without weight loss, exercise alone decreases harmful cholesterol levels in the blood, improves circulation, and therefore reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke. More specifically, aerobic exercise increases the amount of blood your heart can pump with each heartbeat, improves circulation by making your blood vessels healthier, and increases the production of oxygen-metabolizing enzymes that allow you to use oxygen more efficiently and to eliminate waste products from your system. It also burns calories, resulting in weight loss. The result is a reduction of specific risk factors—and probably weight loss as well.

It has become the accepted way of measuring the intensity of aerobic exercise. Your target heart rate is the level you need to maintain for at least 20 minutes to impact your cardiovascular fitness. It is not one number. Rather, it\\'s a certain zone or percentage range of the maximum heart rate (that is, the most beats per minute that the heart can possibly pump). \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Further, physiologists have come up with very precise numbers relating percentages to \\nthe exerciser\\'s age. The heart rate zone numbers decrease with age, because as a person gets older, the heart muscle, like other muscles, diminishes. With the loss of heart muscle, the maximum heart rate also declines, even in very fit people. This explains why elite athletes generally peak in their 20s and 30s. If they continue training into their 40s, 50s, and beyond, their aim usually is to minimize the erosion of their peak capacity. \\n  ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='af30ca54-5e0f-46ca-bc56-0a279a99fb4d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '281', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='ccfc02e6ad25311f866c9b7f842068ab162280c1e85b675002c7fc4542be919c', text=' \\n \\n \\n \\n In addition to a person\\'s chronological age, his or her fitness level also affects the target \\nheart rate zone. Endurance athletes concentrate their training on adding to their cardiorespiratory system\\'s lifespan instead of focusing on strength training. They work \\nhard on their cardio conditioning to stretch their competitive life for additional years. When older people get into competition, they also tend to look to distance events. Look at the increasing number of people competing in \"masters\" categories in running, \\nswimming, and even the grueling triathlon. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Put another way, the fitness dividend shows up throughout life. A person of any age \\nwho is out of shape doesn\\'t need to work very hard to elevate the heart rate, but to achieve cardiovascular benefits, the level of activity is relatively low. (In other words, an unfit person gets out of breath easily, and his or her heart starts pumping hard even after mild exertion.) By contrast, a very fit person, regardless of age, must run or cycle faster, swim harder, use a higher step, or ratchet up intensity in other ways to reach the appropriate target heart rate for his or her age. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  Finding Your Target Heart Rate\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n You can check your cardiovascular fitness level by taking your resting heart rate \\n(RHR).

If 80 percent is good, you might wonder, isn\\'t 100 percent better? Not at all. One hundred percent is all-out effort—the maximum anyone\\'s cardiovascular system can pump. It is the point at which the body cannot process enough oxygen to sustain any more physical effort. This is called the anaerobic zone, and it\\'s not someplace you want to be. Only competitive athletes routinely train above 80 percent, and only occasionally do they push to their limit. Wearing a heart-rate monitor and under the watchful eye of a trainer or physiologist, they can push to 100 percent of their maximum heart rate and can cross the anaerobic threshold, but they do so just for short bursts of only about a minute. \\n  \\nMonitoring Your Heart Rate   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n When you begin working out, check your heart rate periodically to make sure you are \\nworking at the appropriate level of intensity for your goals. Aerobic instructors usually build into the fabric of the class a time for everyone to check his or her heart rate. To measure your heart rate, press your middle and second (or fourth) finger gently against your carotid artery on the side of your neck just below the jaw hinge or on the inside of your wrist, medical-style. Although the pulse feels the strongest on the carotid artery, some people get a little woozy from affecting blood flow to the brain. If this happens to you, the wrist is the best place to check your heart rate. You don\\'t have to check your heart rate for a full minute. Starting at zero, count for six seconds and then multiply by 10 or do it for 10 seconds and then multiply by six. The result will be the same. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n One of the interesting phenomena about sports participation and fitness conditioning is \\nthat veterans often have a good sense of where they are aerobically and can tell, from the way their bodies are reacting, where in the aerobic zone they are working. Ironically, these committed, long-time exercisers are also often the ones who want confirmation of exactly where they are. They can tell how hard they are breathing, sense how quickly their hearts are beating, and know whether they can still talk while working out. For such types, heart-rate monitors are the devices of choice. They monitor your heart rate throughout your cardio workout.

Some hardcore walkers eventually become race walkers, participating in a demanding sport that is generally eclipsed by running. Other people start walking, but first break into a jog and then often begin running. Remember Forest Gump? He was a fictitious character, but he symbolized what real people have experienced.

You should be able to \\nfeel the entire cycle moving smoothly—heel strike, forward roll of the weight, and push off from the toe.

When people say that walking is as good as running, they are referring to fitness walking. PowerWalking goes by several names. Fitness walking relates to all the good things it does for you. \"Healthwalking\" is a word coined in 1982 by Jake Jacobson, the walking coach (who has worked with Olympic athletes) and motivational speaker who began promoting walking for fitness in the late 1970s. Race walking is a specific athletic technique distinguished by the aggressive hip movement required to maintain foot contact with the ground at all times and to straighten the knee with each step while at maximum speed. Another race-walking characteristic is the powerful elbows-up arm pump. Race walking takes training and practice to perfect, and many people don\\'t even want to do it because it looks so ungainly. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Even without the refinements of race walking, you can increase the challenge of your \\nwalking program by stepping up your pace, a dding hills, adding distance, or extending \\nyour time. Another way to intensify your workout is to carry hand weights. One-pounders, or two at the most, can do wonders in revving up your intensity. Never use ankle weights for walking, because they can stress your ankle and knee joints. One popular, balanced, walking-based routine alternates one day of walking for 60 minutes with one day of walking for 30 minutes and then doing moderate strength training for 30 minutes. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='bb5e629d-a5b4-4d17-b309-8db83b2d430c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '301', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='c09c05de958ed9bf847a21aec12b92442186777674e8437ec7dd05a275eb0eda', text=' \\n The American Volkssport Association conducts some 2,000 recreational walking \\nevents annually and has developed about 1,000 r outes in major cities, interesting towns, \\nparks, and historic sites that you can follow on your own.

Go ahead. Put a little spring in your step, let your rear foot leave the ground before the front foot lands, and let your arms swing in rhythm with your stride. The aerobic benefits of a slow jog and a fitness walk are similar, but you might find yourself getting wi nded sooner because your feet are not in \\nconstant contact with the ground. You don\\'t have to give up walking completely. When you start running, walking can still serve as your warm-up and your cool-down. If you get serious about running and go for more speed and distance, a slow jog can serve as your warm-up and your cool-down. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Once you decide you want to begin running, a good way to gently move into it is by \\njogging, which is a slow, recreational form of running. In the beginning, you can \\nalternate walking and jogging either by time or by distance. If you have access to a track, try this: You can begin by alternately walking half a lap and jogging half a lap. Gradually increase your jogging time in relation to your walking time. Jog three-quarters of a lap and walk the rest. Then alternate running a lap and walking fractions of laps. Finally, eliminate the walk (except for the warm-up and cool-down periods) until you can jog for about 45 minutes. \\n  If you use park paths, streets, or sidewalks instead of a track, you can start your shift to \\nbecoming a runner by alternating one to three minutes of walking with two or three minutes of jogging, or you can jog a block and then walk a block. In the beginning, you might find that such a \"sprint\" is all you can do, but pretty soon, the jogging segments will come more easily.

The vibration from the heel strike is like a shock wave that travels up the leg at 200 miles per hour. By the time it reaches the hip, it has been reduced to one sixth of its original intensity. By the time it reaches the head, this vibration is one tenth of its initial intensity, which means your brain may be serene, but your ankles, knees, and hips feel the jolt with each footfall. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n The good news, however, is that running does not cause bone or joint degeneration.

This new sport is based on a design in which four wheels are lined up one after another, which makes them easier to use and more maneuverable than old-time skates. First marketed in 1980, in-line skates have all but supplanted traditional roller skates. In-line skates have one row of wheels \\nin a line (hence the name in-line skates). Go fast, feel balanced, and get a workout \\nwhile rolling along on a recreation path, in the park, or in a big empty parking lot. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Today's skates are designed for comfort, balance, and ease of use. Made with high-\\nperformance materials, they provide support and are breathable to keep your feet cool. Skating works your quads, thighs, and glutes, among other muscles. Experts note that you can burn about 400 calories an hour by skating at a rather leisurely pace. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n If you want to try skating, many bike and out door stores rent skates by the hour or by \\nthe day. Wrist sprains and fractures are among the most common skating injuries. It is \\nimportant to wear a helmet, wristguards or special gloves, and kneepads and elbow \\npads when you are in-line skating. When you're just starting out, your feet might get tired within an hour, so don't have expectations of skating all day. A good place to try skating is on a smooth recreation path that is relatively flat or in a big parking lot without cars and traffic. There are brakes on the back of skates to help you slow down or stop. As you improve, you will find that you can maneuver up and down gentle grades, skate backward, and make quick turns. Rollerblade, the company that developed in-line skating, has divided the sport into three skill levels and even offers moderately priced classes and workshops in a program called Bladeschool.

Another option for preschoolers is a \\ndurable child\\'s bicycle seat that mounts behind the saddle of your bike. Children old enough to \"help\" pedal can ride a bike extender, which consists of a wheel, pedals, and handlebars, that attaches to the back of your bicycle. However your youngster cycles with you, make sure he or she wears a helmet—and set a good example by wearing one, too. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Road-racing.

It really is just a form of walking, but it implies that you are on a scenic and somewhat uneven trail going through the woods, across a wildflower meadow, to a waterfall, or up a mountaintop—and it's a great way to spend quality time with family or friends. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Hiking takes you into nature, whether it's on a trail through the woods at a nearby state \\npark, a hike to a scenic mountain vista, or a walk on the wild side in an exotic locale. For a sedentary city dweller, even a brisk walk to and around the local park can seem like a hike, and it does benefit your heart and muscle tone. While hiking, you can talk with your hiking companions or simply enjoy the environment in silence. Look around at the flowers and vegetation and learn more about where you are. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Enjoy friends and aerobic fitness \\npedaling along a scenic mountain road. \\n(Photo: Anne W.

The first slide \\nboards were homemade, but now they are standa rdized. A board consists of a slick, flat, \\npersonal track that is 5, 6, or 7 feet long. It usually is made of polymer with a super-slick top surface and rubber bumpers on each end that can be adjusted in one-foot increments to customize the board\\'s length. Inline and speed skaters and cross-country skiers who use special skating skis (see Chapter 14, \"More Great Moves\") use slide boards to increase their lateral strength and power as well as the balance, agility, and speed that their sports require. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Slide classes use the same type of board. You put nylon booties on over your footwear \\nso you can slide easily across the board\\'s smooth surface. Classes involve pushing off from one foot to another in power-skating strokes. You will get significant aerobic \\nbenefit from powering across the board to get from one bumper to the other, especially \\nif you couple the move with arm swings. In addition to the cardio workout and increased endurance, you will find that slide classes tone your hips and both the inner and outer thighs. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n For the smoothest, safest workout, wear fl at-soled aerobics or dance shoes under the \\nbooties when you slide, not running shoes with heavy treads. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  Plyometrics, Please   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='20b1c176-7373-4658-ae62-6d029bcc3ae7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '352', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='3c59f387eea68e20b68f2b172dbb594fbbb42fc46b41521d3f2aab5ee12e3c86', text=' \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Plyometrics, the machine-gun routines of aerobics classes, include rapid-fire moves \\nthat contract and extend the muscles to enhance strength and power as well as your aerobic fitness and metabolic rate.

First you practice the foot and arm moves with an imaginary rope to get the timing and coordination down. Then you practice the same steps while holding both handles in one hand and swinging the rope on one side of your \\nbody. Finally, you put it together with the jump rope twirling in two hands. Jumping rope is an intense and effective aerobic activity. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Many instructors also include a jumping segment in their cardio or general fitness \\nclasses, and a few studios even offer classes that center around jumping rope. For basic rope jumping, keep your hands at hip level with your palms facing forward. Stand erect \\nwith your head up, and keep your elbows bent at a comfortable distance from your body. Turn the rope with a motion of the wrists, push off from the balls of your feet, and land lightly. You can also adapt moves from aerobics classes, such as marching or running in place, while turning the rope alongside your body. These resting or neutral moves will help you stay in your target heart rate zone. Once you are comfortable, you won't have to jump more than an inch or two off the ground to derive aerobic benefit. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n A good jump rope is not just a hunk of old clothesline, but even a good rope is an \\ninexpensive fitness investment. Serviceable models found in gyms and sporting-goods stores are plastic or beaded-plastic in construction with comfortable, full-rotation handles. Most ropes weigh about half-a-pound and are sturdy enough to make a full loop without flopping and tangling under your f eet. Ropes come in different lengths. \\nWhether selecting a rope in the gym or buying your own, find the right length by holding the rope in one hand, stepping on the bottom of the loop, and pulling it up. The tips of the handles should reach your chest or armpits. For experienced exercisers who are not susceptible to wrist or elbow problems, weighted ropes (from one to six pounds) are available to boost the aerobic benefit even more.

More than the comfort of being underwater, however, aquatic exercise is the ultimate impact-free exercise that is kind to the joints and is good for cardio endurance as well as strengthening and toning (see Chapter 8, \"Iron-Free Resistance Training\").

Developed by physical therapists for rehabilitation, \\nto help people with chronic physical conditions, and to speed injured athletes\\' postinjury recovery and training, it has grown into a family of pool-exercise programs. There are two basic body positions. In shallow water, exercises are done with the body in a vertical position and feet on the pool bottom, water at chest level. In deep water, participants use flotation equipment because they cannot touch the bottom.

They all carry the image of clean air and sunshine, but the great outdoors isn't always so great. Polluted air, heavy traffic, and uncomfortable humidity are among the factors that can drive all but the most dedicated outdoor exercisers indoors, and overexposure to the sun has been established as a health hazard. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n If you live in a city with bad air pollution, try to schedule outdoor activities such as \\nwalking, running, cycling, or in-line skating as early in the morning as possible.

Traffic is a major cause of the problem. The daily pollution index is therefore likely to be at its lowest at dawn. However, if you have allergies, exercising outdoors in the morning can be problematic because that's when the pollen count is the highest. Less vehicular traffic equals safer cycling and running as well. From an air-quality standpoint, the worst possible time to exercise outdoors is during rush hour, especially the afternoon rush. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n How can you deal with these problems and still exercise outdoors? You'll have to adapt \\nyour program. Instead of city streets, you can walk, run, or bike in a park, on a \\nrecreational path, or on a promenade along a river, lake, or seashore, because the plants partially counteract the pollutants in the air.

Before buying anything, evaluate the space you plan to use. Try to set up \\nyour workout space in a room that you truly want to spend time in. Measure the space \\navailable, write the measurements down, and take your tape measure with you when you go to look at equipment. Make sure the equipment you want fits into the space that you have. Remember to measure vertical space as well as floor space. Some equipment folds up, but if you have particularly low ceilings or hanging plants in the room that will be your gym, some apparatus may be a little too tall. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Test.  Wear workout gear or something loose and comfortable to the store and try out \\nthe apparatus you are interested in. Test not only the equipment you think you'll buy, \\nbut take a little time to try out other types of machines as well. \\n  \\nIf the store carries several brands, check them all out, and have the salesperson go over \\nthe features of each so that you can evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of each model. Even if \\nyou don't think you'd want a particular machine, you might find that you like it when you try it. \\n \\n \\n  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='043c9fdd-eef7-4105-8648-f5edae9b7e59', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '378', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='faa47134390e8ff06541a393de2e137214a9e2228dfefac799da8a118ba6ee01', text=' ♦ Shop wisely.  Buy for value, not just price. Don\\'t automatically go for the cheapest \\nequipment, because a flimsy apparatus won\\'t be as smooth or as enjoyable to use as a \\nquality model. By the same token, don\\'t be sucked into purchasing a high-end training apparatus that has features you\\'ll never use. Think about what you need and make sure that your choice is going to work well and last for a long time. The old adage \"You get what you pay for\" also applies to gym equipment. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Find bargains.  Expertise, warranties, and the opportunity to comparison shop are \\ngood reasons to make such a high-ticket purchase as exercise apparatus from a \\nreputable dealer. However, it may be beyond your budget to buy that way—even if the store is running a sale. New equipment is available at discount stores, but it generally is \\nof lower quality than at dealers specializing in sports or workout products, and the sales \\nstaff at big-box chains can be spectacularly unknowledgeable about exercise equipment. You can find used equipment at garage sales; listed in your local newspaper\\'s Classified section; and even in thrift stores such as the Salvation Army, \\nGoodwill, or your local hospital auxiliary or other charity. The price will be right, and you might score the deal of a workout lifetime. Or the equipment might be abused, worn-out, or simply unsuitable for you. You can\\'t comparison shop, there are no guarantees, and you won\\'t have any recourse but to try to sell or donate the apparatus if it doesn\\'t work for you. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Inquire.  Ask questions about warranties when you make a purchase. A reputable \\ndealer often will give you a trial period during which you can use the equipment at \\nhome for, say, 30 days and then return it for a full refund or merchandise credit if it isn\\'t right for you. Also ask about repair and maintenance policies. Again, the dealer should have a trained technician available to handle repairs and maintenance. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Set the tone.  Set up your equipment in an area you enjoy being in. Setting things up \\nin a dark, cold, and uninviting basement is a formula for procrastination, excuses, and \\npossibly failure to meet your goals. If your gym area is part of your regular living space, think of creative ways to make it look good when not in use. Decorating ideas include a plant on wheelers, a decorative Japanese shoji screen, or a folding screen that can partition the room and easily go in front of the machine when not in use. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='539d193d-b842-45b7-894f-0757e0c3da6a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '379', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='9f95efaa7006186a414de3f187f3ef1421c6b1b769f7db5281f2ae0c0d2b638a', text=' \\n ♦ Entertain yourself.

You can do laps on a flight of stairs, being \\ncareful to maintain your footing.

Carry a set of weights if you want to increase the workload. Start with five to 10 minutes of going up and down the stairs. If you live in a highrise apartment building, all the better, because you can go up and down many stairs. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n You also can use the bottom step as if it were a bench or a step in a gym. Stand two to \\nthree feet in front of the bottom step. Step one foot forward onto the bottom step and lunge, rising on the toes of your back foot and taking care not to move your front knee \\nfarther forward than your ankle. Repeat using the other gastrocnemius leg. To strengthen your gastrocnemius, the big calf muscle, stand with the front half of your feet on the bottom step and your heels hanging off the step. Rise onto your toes and then slowly allow your heels to drop below the level of the step (keeping your legs straight but without locking the knees).

(Your lower leg should be perpendicular to the floor.) Then push off again with the front leg and return to the starting position. Do four repetitions on each side, and then alternate. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Decline push-ups.  Use the desk chair in your room as a bench. Put your feet on the \\nseat and your hands on the floor to do decline push-ups, which are an advanced and \\nvery effective workout for your chest, shoulders, and triceps. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Tricep dips.  Using the desk chair again, place both hands behind you on the seat and \\nkeep your feet under your knees. Lower your body until your butt is just off the floor or \\nstraight out in front of you and your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Because this works your shoulders and triceps, it combines well with push-ups for a basic upper-body workout. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Back extension.  Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands behind \\nyour head. With your legs fairly straight  (but without locking your knees) and your \\nback straight, bend at the waist until your torso is parallel to the floor. Then slowly raise your torso from the hips. Alternatively, lie down prone (face down) on the floor, and simultaneously lift one arm and one leg a few inches off the floor, stretching rather than arching your back. Some people prefer raising the arm and leg on the same side, while others are more comfortable raising the opposite arm and leg. These no-equipment exercises stretch and strengthen your lower back, which is especially useful when you are traveling and have been carrying a heavy briefcase, a laptop, or carry-on luggage through airports and across sprawling parking lots. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ecf220b5-235f-4b3d-817d-e408e562ce5c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '389', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='bd46afd417caf7153a8e7cfb5bbcaec31d1b112d12d0f52a278889991ff276df', text=\" ♦ Leg raises.

A training program of boxing for fitness most likely will feature \"bag work\" (punching a heavy bag, speed bag, and double- ended bag), skipping rope, and shadow \\nboxing. Bag work, in particular, provides both aerobic conditioning (because of the constant movement) and strength training (because the bag offers resistance for your muscles to work against with every punch you throw). Serious boxers do a lot of bag work, supplemented with jumping rope, running, agility training, and weightlifting. In other words, they are seriously into cross-training. They also practice fighting against an opponent, but if you\\'re into this for fitness and not for the sport, such sparring is optional. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n People who use boxer training moves for fitness often assert that punching is not only \\ngood exercise but also a dynamite stress-reliever.

Her workout emphasizes strength training with and without weights as well as aerobic conditioning. Her daily regime includes abdominal, leg, and flexibility exercises without weights. She pumps iron three days a week, runs five to seven miles twice a week, and does bag work, wind sprints, and sparring with a partner the other days.

When \\nbabies are small, parents move them and their paraphernalia all day. Carrying an infant, \\nwalking him or her when colic strikes, pushing a carriage and then a stroller, and even dealing with endless rounds of laundry keeps parents, especially moms, in motion. When children grow and become more self-reliant, parents take that as a cue to sit down and rest. Physical inactivity, however, takes its toll. If you think you are tired when babies and toddlers require constant attention and chores, it\\'s just a prelude to the constant lethargy you will feel if you take it too easy when your children get older. Being an active participant in life sets an excellent example for your children, and participating in sports together can be a treasured family bond. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n Here are some ways you can spend quality active time with your children while you rev \\nup your metabolism and have fun, too: \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Swimming.  Sign up infants and toddlers for baby swim classes.

Partner up with \\nanother parent and take turns watching the children. When you're off duty, take advantage of the time and go for a short walk. Just walking on resistant sand strengthens your shins, calves, and even the muscles in your feet. Walking barefoot on sand naturally sloughs and smoothes the skin on the bottom of your feet. Wading adds the resistance of water to your walking, as long as you keep moving and don't merely stand knee-deep in the water. Toss a beach ball around with your kids or help them build a sand castle. This isn't major exercise as much as just a fun time. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n♦ Bicycling.  Go for a family bike ride. When your children are little, you can hitch up a \\nspecial bicycle trailer designed to hold a t oddler or two. Pedaling yourself, your bike, the \\ntrailer, and the tyke can be a real workout.

Team sports, which \\nprovide exercise done in a group, include volleyball, basketball, soccer, softball, hockey, and any other competitive sport you might have played in junior high and high school. With the passage of time, they might now seem like \"lost\" sports, but you might have a hankering to pick one of them up again. Go for it. They provide fitness benefits and camaraderie, and they do exist for adults. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Adult recreation leagues provide the framework many people need. You might be \\ntempted to cut a fitness class, but you wouldn\\'t dream of letting your teammates down. So you go and play and, therefore, get exercise. Because of scheduling problems or personal preference, however, you might be the type of person who prefers playing only when you feel like it, or you might travel on business frequently and not have a regular schedule. That\\'s where pickup games come in.

Even in Chicago, with its storied cold and blustery winters,  year-round beach volleyball has its adherents. \\nSand is trucked in from Indiana and is dumped in a former metalwork factory. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota all boast multicourt volleyball centers that host leagues, pickup play, and courtside coed socializing. These facilities offer more exercise and a more with-it scene than such regional recreational staples as bowling. What appeals to Midwesterners in the winter also appeals to Southerners in the summer, where air-conditioned beach volleyball facilities have also been developed. \\n   \\n \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='45c44d0b-f5c7-4e78-8c40-3c8718caa76e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '420', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='133c885a887d0e49696a1f6bd380ca45ca4124ceb4334b32ba94734e15c601c1', text=' \\n \\n You might not get a consistent aerobic workout when you play volleyball, but when \\nyou have to move, you really  move.

This includes lower insurance premiums, fewer parking fees, and less money spent on gasoline, repairs, and maintenance. Bike commuting helps the environment, too. A four-mile round-trip commute just three days a week for one year keeps an estimated 2,340 pounds of emission pollutants out of the air. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ If you use public transportation, perhaps you can walk to and from the train, bus, or \\nsubway on at least one end of your commute.

They recommended that Americans cut their fat intake from the artery-clogging average of 42 percent to no more than 30 percent of their total daily calories. This, the experts believed, was realistic and was about as low as most Americans would go, although many experts would like to see people cut their fat consumption to not more than 20 percent of their daily caloric intake. More recent studies have broken this down to no more than 10 percent in the form of saturated fats (see the section \"The Facts on Fat\" later in this chapter, for information about the differences between saturated and unsaturated fats).

The more isoflavones the soy product contained, the greater the benefit. Dr. John R. Crouse III led a team that studied 156 healthy men and women with blood cholesterol levels of 140 or higher. The people who started with the highest levels of cholesterol (164 or higher) derived the most benefit from a diet rich in soy-based isoflavones and showed the most dramatic decrease in cholesterol levels. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  To Diet or Not to Diet?   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='018c1c53-0d94-4a17-b7c5-a2d772824f3b', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '452', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='6f3bc4682a0e5b161ab94b606a23371e8a84040f19bd2b334ca710c22fe83fb0', text=' \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n In this day and age, the word \"diet\" has become synonymous with altered eating habits \\nto result in weight loss, but \"diet\" actually is a word that refers to daily sustenance.

The trick is to pay attention to the serving size. If you only eat the serving size listed on the package, your calorie and gram count will be quite accurate. Many times, however, the first half-cup, inch, or whatever doesn't seem like enough of what you are eating. Americans tend to eat bigger portions than needed or recommended on the package. Then they wonder why the calories and \\ngrams they think they counted don't produce weight loss. \\n  One of the food industry's modern triumphs is the development of reasonably palatable \\nlow-fat and no-fat foods. A dismal by-product of this development is that people have inferred that calorie consumption no longer matters when fat intake is lower. People seem to think they have the green light to ingest vast quantities of reduced-fat food and not gain weight. In fact, calories do count. In  fact, by eating an excessive quantity of fat-\\nfree foods, people may be deluding themselves into thinking that they will lose weight. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Furthermore, some fat is necessary. It is the fat in foods that releases a hormone called \\ncholecystokinin, which signals satiation, and by eating severely fat-reduced food, the hormone isn't released. Thus people keep eating and eating calorie-laden but fat-\\nreduced meals and snacks, which add up to too many calories. In addition, some dietary \\nfat is necessary for the body to process fat-soluble vitamins. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Don't use a workout program as an excuse to chow down on a huge steak every day. \\nThe recommended daily protein requirement is .8 gram per kilogram of body weight, which translates to a daily maximum of 60 grams for an average adult-just a shade over 2 ounces! \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='f47068a2-d49a-47ce-a53b-6f5f65ea68bf', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '457', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='2c4a6d68ebd7a999c519457741cc3257c15e80d22e643f55f480299c5bd2bcb5', text=' \\n  \\n \\n \\n  The Facts on Fat   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n It is important to watch your fat intake, but some fats are good, even essential to your \\nwell-being.

The highly toned gym rats usually are so busy looking at themselves in the mirror that they won\\'t bother paying attention to you or what you\\'re wearing. \\n  \\nStill, it\\'s nice to know that there are many options to suit a great range of exercisers. The \\nrange includes elaborate and expensive clubs offering a mind-boggling array of classes and programs in drop-dead-gorgeous settings to bare-bones and functional public gyms. All levels of gyms have some predictable characteristics in common—and some that vary widely.

You can\\'t exercise one part of the body and expect to lose fat in that area. Repeat after me: There\\'s no such thing as spot reducing! \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n ♦ Aerobic rider.

In a study sponsored by the American \\nCouncil on Exercise (ACE) and conducted by California State University at Northridge, aerobic-rider exercisers follo wing manufacturers\\' guidelines burned only \\n50 percent or fewer calories than on a treadmill. Even when they pushed to the most strenuous workouts possible, the rider exercisers still burned about 25 percent fewer calories than on a treadmill.

Out of shape? Probably. Willpower-impaired or simply confused? Most certainly. Other than that, however, the assumption is that there are no other roadblocks to exercising. That's quite an assumption. At various times in your life, your exercise program must be tailored to fit particular circumstances.

A very general \\nanswer is \"yes\" with some caveats. It usually is all right to work out if you already are fit when you become pregnant.

Exercise can help ease some of pregnancy\\'s discomforts, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, and even the nausea that many women experience during their first trimester. Research shows that women who exercise while \\nthey\\'re pregnant feel strong, fit, and energetic. In addition, they tend to experience \\nfewer of the discomforts that abound late in pregnancy, they gain slightly less weight, and they bounce back more quickly after their baby is born. Therefore, if you aren\\'t working out when you are thinking about having a baby, prepregnancy is a good time to get into shape.

Swimming and aquatic classes also are excellent workouts. Swimming is the only time you can lay prone (on your tummy) for an extended period of time, and it gives your back a well-deserved break. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n ♦ Be alert to your center of gravity.

Don't even think about pushing yourself the way you might if you were not pregnant. Stay on your routine and modify it as your pregnancy progresses.

It\\'s good to start your new life as a mother with healthy new habits. As with any startup program, a trip to the physician is essential before you begin. Find out what your fitness baseline is, and set realistic goals that you will have the time and energy to meet. Refer to Chapters 1 through 3 for guidelines about setting up your fitness plan. If you want to work with a personal trainer to set up a postpartum workout program, signing up with a woman who has had a child and has gone through the same thing you have is a good idea. She will be an empathetic expert. \\n  \\n \\n \\n  Toddler Time   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n As children grow, just keeping up with them can be a workout in itself. Including your \\nbaby in your fitness routine can be a rewarding experience, and it can add some challenge to the workout. Most babies love to be pushed along in a stroller. They love the motion. The fresh air is good for them, and the sights and sounds are stimulating. That being true, use your baby as an excuse for taking long walks or even jogs rather than as an excuse not to exercise outdoors. Nowadays, sturdy jogging-strollers are built \\nwith three wheels and a heavy-duty design. They can be pushed on uneven side-walks or unpaved paths while walking or jogging. Regular strollers are sturdy and work well for walks along paved paths. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n Even many health clubs accommodate mothers with small children. Some offer \"mom-\\nand-me\" classes and feature exercises that include the baby. Not only do you not lose the precious time you like to spend with your child, these classes also will give you some ideas for at-home exercises that are good for you and fun for your child, too. Some health clubs and recreation centers offer child-care for infants while moms work out. Although you might not want to leave a small infant in child-care for too long, this break will give you the opportunity to take an aerobics class, to do some strength training, and to work on your abdominal muscles to firm them back up after being stretched from pregnancy. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='6575e143-7987-4763-a764-73c03fd1e023', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '527', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='b89ae7bae92797c539e56af8bc828dcb84860572254f1a11f1dcdc2954442ee8', text=\" If you need the motivation of an exercise buddy, the companionship and incentive of \\nanother mom to work out with is that much more helpful.

The cold still needs to run its course, however, so exercising won\\'t shorten its duration. When you are ready to start exercising again after you\\'ve been ill, start slowly and monitor your pulse rate. Experts caution against working out any time you have a body temperature of 99.5 degrees or higher. Fever is a sign that your body is fighting a virus, which is enough of a \"workout.\" At the very least, fever increases the chance of dehydration; more seriously, exercising vigorously could cause the virus to invade your heart or the surrounding muscle. \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='7f15ffc5-0717-4609-a171-8f3f3259f240', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '529', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='7ddbb25cd290bfef9f93ac40549b302f916c72fc38ef294a342d7bf0c96dc679', text=\" \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n It's okay to work out with the sniffles, \\nbut take it at a slower pace. \\n(Photo: Courtesy of Telluride Visitor Services)  \\n  \\nIn addition to the numbers that pop up on the thermometer, be mindful of other signs that \\nyou might be too sick to exercise.

The American \\nAssociation of Retired Persons begins recruiting new members when they turn 50, which is a statistical turning point in physical fitness. Unless they do something proactive to counteract natural aging, from about age 20 to 49, people lose half-a-pound of muscle mass every year. After age 50, that loss changes to one pound a year. The result is decreased strength, coordination, balance, flexibility, and more. Nearly 40 percent of Americans over the age of 55 report that they participate in no leisure-time physical activity. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Even for people who have not previously exercised, these losses can be counteracted—\\nastonishingly, at any age. In the mid 1980s, Dr. Walter Frontera, a scientist at the Tufts Center on Aging, performed a study with 60- and 70-year-olds. Some were put on an exercise program; others were not. Within 12 weeks, the exercisers were 100 to 175 percent stronger than their sedentary contemporaries. In a follow-up study, Dr. Maria Fiatarone, also of the Tufts Center on Ag ing, recruited volunteers aged 86 to 96 in a \\nnursing home. Subjects in the study participated in a high-intensity strength-training workout, starting out at a safe level and pr ogressing gradually.

It helps many of them remain \\nindependent far longer, enhancing their f eelings of dignity and self-worth.

If you prefer moderate heat, you\\'ll find the lower benches to be more comfortable. Steady heat is transmitted into the sauna enclosure through a pile of hot rocks encased in a small wooden frame. If a wooden water bucket has been placed next to the frame, it is customary to periodically throw a ladleful of water on the rocks to add a brief burst of moisture to the dry air. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n Saunas are meant to be used in the nude.

(A towel to sit or lie on prevents your privates from frying on the hot wood.) \\n  \\n \\n  \\n In the United States, people might use a sauna in the nude if it is specifically part of the \\nmen\\'s or women\\'s locker room, but they virtually always wear bathing suits in a coed sauna. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n A traditional Scandinavian sauna often will have a bucket of water with birch or oak \\nbranches placed in it. These branches are used by sauna goers to \"spank\" one another lightly to increase blood circulation. Another traditional Scandinavian ritual is to roll in the snow, or even jump into a cold lake or an ocean, which many Scandinavian saunas are located next to. This is done right after emerging from the sauna, and it does get the blood flowing. In the United States, this cold plunge often is achieved with a cold shower. \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n A steam room is a fully tiled room that resembles an oversized shower stall, but it has \\ntiled benches to sit or lie on. Nozzles around the room intermittently emit very moist heat into the air. The steam is so dense that it looks like a cloud or a thick fog, but it\\'s hot enough to feel even in your lungs. Sometimes eucalyptus oil is sprayed onto the nozzles, and this helps open up your sinuses . Many people find the wet heat and hissing \\nbursts of steam to be particularly soothing. \\n  \\n \\n  \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='2980e46f-c5ed-449f-84c2-dbd22171e468', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '563', 'file_name': 'fitness-guide.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, hash='d09ac75221b28c7d36924a63c0e47a3173d888cd80d690376055166aa70faf14', text=' These heat treatments provide stress relief as well as physical relaxation.

(Most people prefer to be nude so the massage therapist can work unrestricted.) The massage therapist will drape a sheet or blanket over you and will expose only the body part he or she is working on. Your private parts will stay covered at all times.
